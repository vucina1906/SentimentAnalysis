- This is ann app that helps Booking Hotels to analyse reviews and highlight causes of negative reviews so they can improve on them. 

- The app includes booking review selenium scraper that I created from strach using selenium and chromedriver. After scraper collect all reviews and store them in csv file (under name "all_reviews.csv"), than the app automatically import csv file and analyse it with lstm_model that is also automatically loaded when the app is started. Model is pretrained on dataset from Kaggle website link https://www.kaggle.com/code/baranochnikov/sentiment-analysis-for-hotel-reviews-booking-com/input . All analyses for model creation was done in "BookingSentimentAnalysis.ipynb" and for model training I used Google Colab GPU. After model is loaded it analyse all_reviews.csv file and based on sentiment analysis it will sort reviews into negative, neutral and positive. The app will than plot those reviews but also analyse further negative reviews and plot them using WordCloud, based on word frequences in negative reviews, so later users of the app can check what was most usual causes of negative reviews.

- For scraping the app uses selenium. You have to download the Google Chrome browser and the accurate Chrome driver version (chromedriver.exe should be in the same folder as the app.py script). Versions must be the same. Check your Google Chrome version and for example, if your version is 129.0.6668.101 you should download Chrome driver version 129.0.6668. Install the exact version of selenium from the requirements.txt file. At the time you use this code, your Chrome version can be updated to a newer version from now so check it first.
